# Context

This SDK seems to be developed for a [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) based system. It utilizes the Ubuntu 16.04 OS running [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic).

There are usually not major issues using a newer version of ROS with older ROS packages, but please verify yourself and confirm the possibility in this [issue](https://github.com/Temi-Robot-Sensors/Depth-Camera/issues/2). 

For more information on compiling navigate to the documentation folder for the [README](documentation/) file.
